In that post we will check out [Writer](https://eed3si9n.com/herding-cats/Writer.html]) of "herding cats" series by eed3si9n.


### Writer
[Scala with cats](https://books.underscore.io/scala-with-cats/scala-with-cats.html) says: `cats.data.Writer` is a monad that lets us carry a log along with a computation. We can use it to record messages, errors, or additional data about a computation, and extract the log alongside the final result.

#### Typing

Let's steal idea of `Logged` type from the book:
```scala
type Logged[A] = Writer[Vector[String], A]
```

On the left side we have our structure to keep logs.
On the right we have our `A` value. Hence, we can fix the type to persist log and sole generic will be our `A` type for values.

Under the hood we need `Monoid` for log lines. Reasoning for having full-featured `Monoid` is necessity to make logging optional and produce computation results without any logs at all. `Monoid[L].empty` helps with that demand. And we need `Applicative[F]` to pack values.
```scala
def liftF[F[_], L, V](
  fv: F[V]
)(
  implicit monoidL: Monoid[L], F: Applicative[F]
): WriterT[F, L, V] =
    WriterT(F.map(fv)(v => (monoidL.empty, v)))
```

#### Writer as WriterT parametrized with Id

Yo can notice that we started to deal with `WriterT[F, L, V]` instead of `Writer`.
`Writer` is an alias for `WriterT` with fixed [Id](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/id.html) data type. 
```scala
type Writer[L, V] = WriterT[Id, L, V]
```

#### API

##### Run

We have `run` that "unpack" `WriterT` into tuple.
```scala
123.pure[Logged].run === (Vector(), 123)
```

##### Map

`map` allows tranformation of value.
```
Writer("example", 2).map(_ * 2).run === ("example", 4)
```

##### Ap
You can apply lifted function to your value with `ap`.

```scala
val multiplyByTwo: Writer[Vector[String], Int => Int] =
  Writer(Vector("multiplied by two"), _ * 2)

val (logs, value) = Writer(Vector("initial state"), 2).ap(multiplyByTwo).run

logs === Vector("multiplied by two", "initial state")
value === 4
```

#### Usage
`Writer` is not something you can observe really often.

Practical example is implementations of loggers for tests.

```scala
import org.typelevel.log4cats.extras.WriterLogger

val logger = WriterLogger()
logger.info("Hi, I'm message")

val logged: WriterT[Id, List[LogMessage], Unit] = logger.info("Hi, I'm message")
val message = logged.run._1.head

message.level === Info
message.message === "Hi, I'm message"
```

[valskalla/odin](https://github.com/valskalla/odin) logger also provides [WriterTLogger](https://github.com/valskalla/odin/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/io/odin/loggers/WriterTLogger.scala).


Note by *SystemFw* (`Typelevel/cats` Discord): 
> The problem with logging in writer is that you will need WriterT of IO, which will fail to log on error
